<h1>HTTP Processing</h1>
<p>The Netcdf-Java library uses the Apache <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html">HttpClient 3.1 library</a> for almost all HTTP processing (a small number of utilities use the java.net package). HttpClient is used to access OPeNDAP datasets, for WCS, WMS, and CdmRemote access, and to <a href="HTTPservice.html">open remote files served over HTTP</a>. The Netcdf-Java library provides <strong>ucar.nc2.util.net.HttpClientManager</strong> to manage HttpClient settings.. Future versions of the Netcdf-Java library will use <a href="http://hc.apache.org/">HttpComponents</a>, the successor to HttpClient. The HttpClientManager API will be kept as backwards compatible as possible.</p>
<p>You can allow default HttpClient settings to be used, unless you need to use HTTP Authentication to access restricted datasets. </p>
<h2>Setting a Proxy Server</h2>
<p>To use a proxy server, set the System properties <strong>http.proxyHost </strong>and<strong> http.proxyPort</strong> before making any calls to the  Netcdf-Java library. One way to do this is to set them on the command line:</p>
<pre>java -D<strong>http.proxyHost</strong>=hostname -D<strong>http.proxyPort</strong>=80 -classpath ... </pre>
<h2>HTTP Authentication </h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>When dataset access must be restricted to authorized users, the server will issue an <em>HTTP authentication challenge</em>. We call these <strong><em>restricted datasets</em></strong>. The HttpClient library handles the details of the HTTP protocol, but the application layer must be responsible for supplying the <em>credentials</em> that authenticate the user. <strong>If you want to access restricted datasets with the  Netcdf-Java library, you must plug-in a <em>CredentialsProvider </em>object </strong>(see <a href="#CredentialProvider">below</a>). </p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p><em>Authentication</em> means establishing the identity of a user. In most cases, this is done with a user name and password. A stronger way to do this is to use digital signatures with client certificates, but generally this is a lot of work. The Netcdf-Java library supports HTTP Basic and Digest Authentication, with or without Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Its up to the server to decide which kind of HTTP authentication is needed. </p>
<p>If you are writing an interactive client application, you might prompt the user for the user name and password. A non-interactive application needs to have some kind of a lookup table or database to supply the information.</p>
<h3>Authorization </h3>
<p>Having established a user's identity, <em>authorization</em> is the process of deciding if that user has the right to access a particular dataset. Most  servers, including the THREDDS Data Server (TDS), use <em>role-based authorization</em>. When a user is logged into a particular server, access is granted based on what <em>roles</em> the user has been given by that server. The practical effect of this is that if the user doesnt have access rights to a dataset, they are not prompted to enter a different username/password. They  have to logout and login as a different user.</p>
<h3>Sessions</h3>
<p>Typically a user makes several or many requests to get data from a particular dataset. Some servers (like the TDS) establish a session that keeps track of a user, so that the user doesn't have to send the username/password with each request. A session is enabled by sending a <em>Session Cookie</em> between the server and client. The session remains established based on the rules of Cookie processing and HTTP Protection Spaces. This means that every time a restricted dataset is opened, the application layer may be asked for user credentials for that dataset. Once authentication and authorization is established, no further prompting is made while the dataset is open, as long as the session doesnt time out. Typically a session times out if there is no activity on it for some time, e.g. 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Servers that dont use sessions or other methods may require that the username/password be sent with every request. </p>
<h3>Plugging in a CredentialsProvider<a name="CredentialProvider"></a></h3>
<p> In order to access restricted datasets with the Netcdf-Java library, you must plug-in a <em>CredentialsProvider</em> that implements  the <strong><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/index.htm">org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.CredentialsProvider</a></strong> interface, which has one method: </p>
<pre>   public <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/Credentials.html" title="interface in org.apache.commons.httpclient">Credentials</a> <b>getCredentials</b>(<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/auth/AuthScheme.html" title="interface in org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth">AuthScheme</a>&nbsp;scheme,
                           String&nbsp;host,
                           int&nbsp;port,
                           boolean&nbsp;proxy)
                           throws <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/auth/CredentialsNotAvailableException.html" title="class in org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth">CredentialsNotAvailableException</a>
</pre>
<p>You can write your own, or, for GUI programs, use the <strong>thredds.ui.UrlAuthenticatorDialog</strong> class, which pops up a Dialog Box, similar to how FireFox and other browsers work. </p>
<pre>    CredentialsProvider provider = new thredds.ui.UrlAuthenticatorDialog(frame);<br>    org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient client = ucar.nc2.util.net.HttpClientManager.init(provider, <strong>userAgent</strong>);
</pre>
<p>The <strong>userAgent</strong> should be the name of your Application, which is added to the HTTP User-Agent header, and allows  servers to track which applications are accessing it. </p>
<h3>Initializing</h3>
<p>Once you have a org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient, you must pass it into the various classes that require it. Here is the standarad initialization sequence used in ToolsUI (GUI):</p>
<pre>
   &nbsp; CredentialsProvider provider = new thredds.ui.UrlAuthenticatorDialog(frame);
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HttpClient client = HttpClientManager.init(provider, "ToolsUI");

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opendap.dap.DConnect2.setHttpClient(client);
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HTTPRandomAccessFile.setHttpClient(client);
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CdmRemote.setHttpClient(client);
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NetcdfDataset.setHttpClient(client);
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WmsViewer.setHttpClient(client);</pre>
<p>You may initialize only the packages you are using.<br>
</p>
<h3>Warning: API will change in 4.2</h3>
<p>We are in the midst of switching to use of HttpClient version 4,  which will affect the API, since the above org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient class is from  HttpClient version 3.<br>
