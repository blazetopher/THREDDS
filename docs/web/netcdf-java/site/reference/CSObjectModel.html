<h1>Coordinate System Object Model</h1>
<p>To understand the Coordinate System Object Model, we first review the basic 
  NetCDF Object Model. This diagram reflects the names in the NetCDF-Java library, 
  but is applicable to any NetCDF file, or language library:</p>

<p>So, a <strong>netCDF</strong> <strong><em>Dataset</em></strong> (aka <strong>netCDF 
  file</strong>) is a collection of <strong>Variables</strong>, <strong>Dimensions</strong>, 
  and global <strong>Attributes, </strong>which can be discovered when the dataset 
  is opened. An <strong><em>Attribute</em></strong> is a key/value pair. A <strong><em>Dimension</em></strong> 
  is a named array length. A <em><strong>Variable</strong></em> is a container 
  for variable Attributes, and for the data itself, which is obtained by calling 
  the read() method. The data is a multidimensional array of primitives, of a 
  type listed in <em><strong>DataType-3</strong></em>. The shape of the data is 
  specified through an array of references to Dimension objects, which are always 
  global in scope.</p>
<p>Coordinate Systems are additional semantics built on top of the basic Netcdf 
  Object Model:</p>

<p>So, a Variable can have zero or more Coordinate Systems. A <em><strong>Coordinate 
  System</strong></em> consists of a list of one or more CoordinateAxis, and zero 
  or more CoordinateTransforms. A <em><strong>CoordinateAxis</strong></em> is 
  a subtype of Variable, and is optionally is classified according to the types 
  in <strong>AxisType</strong>. A <strong>CoordinateTransform</strong> abstractly represents a transformation between 
  CoordinateSystems, and currently is either a <strong>Projection</strong> or a <strong>Vertical Transform</strong>. </p>
<p>A CoordinateAxis can only be part of a Variable's CoordinateSystem if the CoordinateAxis' 
  set of Dimensions is a subset of the Variable's set of Dimensions. This ensures 
  that every data point in the Variable has a corresponding coordinate value for 
  each of the CoordinateAxis in the CoordinateSystem. </p>
<p>Formally, a Variable is thought of as a sampled function whose domain is an 
  index range; each CoordinateAxis is a scalar valued function on the same range; 
  each CoordinateSystem is therefore a vector-valued function on the same range 
  consisting of its CoordinateAxis functions. To take it one step further, when 
  the CoordinateSystem function is invertible, the Variable can be thought of 
  as a sampled function whose domain is the range of the Coordinate System, that 
  is on <strong>Rn</strong> (the product space of real numbers). To be invertible, 
  each CoordinateAxis should be invertible. For a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis 
  this simply means the coordinate values are strictly monotonic. For a 2 dimensional 
  CoordinateAxis, it means that the lines connecting adjacent coordinates do not 
  cross each other. For &gt; 2 dimensional CoordinateAxis, it means that the surfaces 
  connecting the adjacent coordinates do not intersect each other. </p>
<p>The <em><strong>AxisType</strong></em> enumerations are specific to the case 
  of georeferencing coordinate systems. <em>Time</em> refers to the real date/time of the dataset. <em>Latitude</em> and <em>Longitude</em> 
  identify standard horizontal coordinates. <em>Height</em> and <em>Pressure</em> 
  identify the vertical coordinate.<em> GeoX</em> and <em>GeoY</em> are used in 
  transfomations (eg projections) to <em>Latitude</em>, <em>Longitude</em>. <em>GeoZ</em> 
  is used in vertical transformations to vertical <em>Height</em> or <em>Pressure</em>. 
  <em>RadialAzimuth</em>, <em>RadialElevation</em> and <em>RadialDistance</em> designate polar coordinates and are used for Radial DataTypes. <em>RunTime</em> and <em>Ensemble</em> are used in forecast model output data. Often much more detailed information is required (geoid reference, projection 
  parameters, etc), so these enumerations are quite minimal. </p>
<h3>Current Encodings </h3>
<p>NetCDF has long had the convention of specifying a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis 
  with a <em><strong>coordinate variable</strong></em>, which is a Variable with 
  the same name as its single dimension. This is a natural and elegant way to 
  specify a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis, since there is an automatic association 
  of the Coordinate Variable with any Varaible that uses its dimension. Unfortunately 
  there are not similarly elegant ways to specify a multidimensional CoordinateAxis, 
  and so various attribute conventions have sprung up, that typically list the 
  CoordinateAxis variables, for exaple the CF-1.0 Convention::</p>
<pre>  float lat(y,x);
  float lon(y,x);
  float temperature(y,x);
    temperature:coordinates=&quot;lat lon&quot;;
</pre>
<p>Note that in this example, there is no CoordinateSystem object, so the same 
  list has to be added to each Variable, and any CoordinateTransform specifications 
  also have to be added to each Variable. However, the common case is that all 
  the Variables in a NetCDF file use the same Coordinate System.</p>
<p>The <strong>ucar.nc2.dataset</strong> layer reads various Conventions and extracts the Coordinate Systems using the CoordSysBuilder framework. We often use a set of internal attributes called the <a href="CoordinateAttributes.html">&quot;underscore Coordinate&quot;</a> attributes as a way to standardize the Coordinate Systems infomation.</p>
<p>The AxisType enumerations are essential to getting georeferencing coordinate 
  systems unambiguously identified. If units are also supplied for each CoordinateAxis, 
  this information alone is often sufficient for georeferencing the data, at least 
  in a &quot;quick look&quot; situation where precision is not essential.</p>
<p> CoordinateTransforms tend to be complex and discipline-specific. The NetCDF-Java 
  library provides a generic framework for describing 
  needed parameters and their values, plus a way to register third-party implementations at runtime. In addition, we support most of the projections and vertical transformations specified in the <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/index.html">CF-1.0 Convention</a>.</p>
