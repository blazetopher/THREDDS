<h1>Netcdf-Java FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Is the Netcdf-Java library thread-safe?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Underneath a <strong>Variable/NetcdfFile</strong> is (usually) a <strong>java.io.RandomAccessFile</strong> object, which is not thread-safe, because  it keeps the state of the file position. So even if all you want to do is read data in multiple threads, you need to synchronize, typically on the <strong>NetcdFile</strong> object. Alternatively, open a new <strong>NetcdfFile</strong> for each thread. The Threads Data Server (TDS) uses a cache of open <strong>NetcdfFile</strong> files by using the <strong>NetcdfDataset.acquireFile() </strong>method, which allows stateless handling of data requests minimizing file opening and closing..</p>
