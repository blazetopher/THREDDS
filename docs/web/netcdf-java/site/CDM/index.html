<h1>Unidata's Common Data Model Version 4 </h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> Unidata&rsquo;s Common Data Model (CDM) is an abstract <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model">data model</a> for scientific datasets. It merges the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">netCDF</a>, <a href="http://www.opendap.org/">OPeNDAP</a>, and <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/">HDF5</a> data models to create a common API for many types of scientific data. As currently implemented by the NetCDF Java library, it can read (besides OPeNDAP, netCDF, and HDF5) GRIB 1 and 2, BUFR, HDF4, HDF-EOS, NEXRAD,  GINI, GEMPAK fomatted files, among others. A pluggable framework allows other developers to add readers for their own specialized formats. </p>
<p>The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <strong><em>data access layer</em></strong>, also know as the <strong><em>syntactic layer,</em></strong> handles data reading and writing. </li>
  <li>The <strong><em>coordinate system</em></strong> layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general concept for scientific data; we also identify specialized <strong><em>georeferencing coordinate systems</em></strong>, which are important to the Earth Science community.</li>
  <li>The <strong><em>scientific feature type</em></strong> layer identifies specific types of data, such as <em>grids</em>, <em>images</em>, and <em>point data</em>, and adds specialized methods for each kind of data.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Dataset </strong>may be a netCDF, HDF5, GRIB, etc. file, an OPeNDAP dataset, a collection of files, or anything else which can be accessed through the netCDF API. We sometimes use the term <em><strong>CDM dataset</strong></em> to mean any of these possibilities, and to emphasize that a dataset does not have to be a file in netCDF format.</p>
<p>A <strong>Group</strong> is a logical collection of Variables. The Groups in a Dataset form a hierarchical tree, like directories on a disk. A Group has a name and optionally a set of Attributes, Dimensions, EnumTypedefs, and nested Groups <strong>. </strong>There is always at least one Group in a Dataset, the <strong>root Group</strong>, whose name is the empty string.</p>
<p>A <strong>Variable</strong> is a container for data. It has a <em>DataType</em>, a set of Dimensions that define its array shape, and optionally a set of Attributes. Any shared Dimension it uses must be in the same Group or a parent Group. </p>
<p>A <strong>Dimension</strong> has a length, and is used to define the array shape of a Variable. It may be <em>shared</em> among Variables, which provides a simple yet powerful way of associating Variables. When a Dimension is shared, it has a unique name within the Group. If <em>unlimited</em>,  a Dimension's length may increase. If <em>variableLength</em>, then the actual length is data dependent, and can only be found by reading the data. </p>
<p>An <strong>Attribute</strong> has a name and a value, and associates arbitrary metadata with a Variable or a Group. The value can be a one dimensional array of Strings or numeric values.</p>
<p>A <strong>Structure</strong> is a type of Variable that contains other Variables, analogous to a <strong><em>struct</em></strong> in C, or a <em><strong>row</strong></em> in a relational database. In general, the data in a Structure are physically stored close together on disk, so that it is efficient to retrieve all of the data in a Structure at the same time. A Variable contained in a Structure is a <strong>member Variable</strong>, and can only be read in the context of its containing Structure. </p>
<p>A <strong>Sequence</strong> is a one dimensional Structure whose length is not known until you actually read the data. To access the data in a Sequence, you can only iterate through the Sequence, getting the data in one Structure instance at a time. </p>
<p>An <strong>EnumTypedef</strong> is an enumeration of Strings, used by Variables of type <em><strong>enum</strong></em>. </p>
<p>An <strong>Object name</strong> refers to the name of a Group, Dimension, Variable,  Attribute, or EnumTypedef. An object name is a String,  a variable length array of Unicode characters. The <a href="Identifiers.html">set of allowed characters</a> is still being considered. </p>
<p>An <strong>Array</strong> contains the actual data for a Variable after it is read from the disk or network. You get an Array from a Variable by calling <strong><em>read()</em></strong> or its variants. An Array is always rectangular in shape (like Fortran arrays). There is a specialized Array type for each of the DataTypes. </p>
<p><strong>DataType</strong> describes the possible types of data: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>primitive numeric </strong> types are <strong><em>byte, short, int, long, float</em></strong> and <strong><em>double</em></strong>. The integer types (8-bit byte, 16-bit short, 32-bit int, 64-bit long) may be <em>signed</em> or <em>unsigned</em>. Float and double are IEEE encoded. </p>
  <p>A <strong>String</strong> is a variable length array of <a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> characters. When reading/writing a String to a  file or other external representation, the characters are by default <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8 encoded</a> (note that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8). Libraries may use different internal representations, for example the Java library uses UTF-16 encoding. </p>
  <p>The <strong>char</strong> type contains uninterpreted  characters, one character per byte. Typically these contain 7-bit ASCII characters. </p>
  <p>An <strong>enum</strong> type is an enumeration of (distinct integer value, String) pairs.. A Variable with enum type stores  integer values, which are then mapped to  Strings.</p>
  <p>A <strong>StructureData</strong> holds the data for Structures and Sequences, and allows access to each of the member Variable's data. </p>
