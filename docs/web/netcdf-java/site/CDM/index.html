<h1>Unidata's Common Data Model</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> Unidata&rsquo;s Common Data Model (CDM) is an abstract <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model">data model</a> for scientific datasets. It merges the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">netCDF</a>, <a href="http://www.opendap.org/">OPeNDAP</a>, and <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/">HDF5</a> data models to create a common API for many types of scientific data. As currently implemented by the NetCDF Java library, it can read (besides OPeNDAP, netCDF, and HDF5) GRIB 1 and 2, BUFR, NEXRAD, and GINI fomatted files, among others. A pluggable framework allows other developers to add readers for their own specialized formats. </p>
<p>The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <strong><em>data access layer</em></strong>, also know as the <strong><em>syntactic layer,</em></strong> handles data reading and writing. </li>
  <li>The <strong><em>coordinate system</em></strong> layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general concept for scientific data; we also identify specialized <strong><em>georeferencing coordinate systems</em></strong>, which are important to the Earth Science community.</li>
  <li>The <strong><em>scientific data type</em></strong> layer identifies specific types of data, such as <em>grids</em>, <em>images</em>, and <em>point data</em>, and adds specialized methods for each kind of data.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Access Layer Objects </h2>

<p><strong>A Dataset </strong>may be a netCDF, HDF5, GRIB, etc. file, an OPeNDAP dataset, a collection of files, or anything else which can be accessed through the netCDF API. We sometimes use the term <em><strong>CDM dataset</strong></em> to mean any of these possibilities, and to emphasize that a dataset does not have to be a file in netCDF format.</p>
<p>A <strong>Group</strong> is a logical collection of Variables. The Groups in a Dataset form a hierarchical tree, like directories on a disk. A Group has a name and optionally a set of Attributes and Dimensions <strong>. </strong>There is always at least one Group in a Dataset, the <strong>root Group</strong>, whose name is the empty string.</p>
<p><strong>A Variable</strong> is a container for data. It has a <em>DataType</em>, a set of Dimensions that define its array shape, and optionally a set of Attributes.</p>
<p>A <strong>Dimension</strong> has a length, and is used to define the array shape of a Variable. It may be <em>shared</em> among Variables, which provides a simple yet powerful way of associating Variables. When a Dimension is shared, it has a unique name within the Group. If <em>unlimited</em>,  a Dimension's length may increase. If <em>variableLength</em>, then the actual length is data dependent, and is used to implement the equivilent of ragged arrays.</p>
<p>An <strong>Attribute</strong> has a name and a value, and associates arbitrary metadata with a Variable or a Group. The value can be a one dimensional array of Strings or numeric values.</p>
<p>A <strong>Structure</strong> is a type of Variable that contains other Variables, analogous to a <strong><em>struct</em></strong> in C. In general, the data in a Structure are physically stored close together on disk, so that it is efficient to retrieve all of the data in a Structure at the same time. </p>
<p>An <strong>Array</strong> contains the actual data for a Variable after it is read from the disk or network. You get an Array from a Variable by calling <strong><em>read()</em></strong> or its variants. An Array is always rectangular in shape (like Fortran arrays). </p>
<p>The <strong>primitive</strong> types are <strong><em>byte, char, short, int, long, float</em></strong> and <strong><em>double</em></strong>, same as in the Java language. The integer types (byte, short, int, long) may be signed or unsigned. Together with <strong><em>String, Structure</em></strong> and <em><strong>enum</strong></em>, these are the possible values of a  Variable's <strong>DataType. </strong> </p>
<p>A <strong>String</strong> is a variable length array of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters. Note that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.</p>
<p>An <strong>enum</strong> type is an enumeration of (distinct integer value, String) pairs.. A Variable with enum type stores  integer values, which are then mapped to the String values. </p>
<p>A <strong>Sequence</strong> is a one dimensional Variable whose length is not known until you actually read the data. All other Variable types know what their array lengths are without having to read the data. You can have sequences of sequences, which is equivalent to ragged arrays.</p>

<h2>Coordinate Systems</h2>

</ul>
<p>It may have a <strong>coordinate Variable</strong>, which gives each index a coordinate value. </p>
