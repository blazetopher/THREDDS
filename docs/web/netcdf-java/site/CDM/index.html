<h1>Unidata's Common Data Model</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> Unidata&rsquo;s Common Data Model (CDM) is an abstract data model for scientific datasets. </p>
<p>ambitious project to unify scientific data access. It merges the OPeNDAP, netCDF, and HDF5 data models to create a common API for many types of data. As currently implemented by the NetCDF Java library, it can read (besides OPeNDAP, netCDF, and HDF5) GRIB 1 and 2, BUFR, NEXRAD, and GINI, among others. A pluggable framework allows other developers to add readers for their own specialized formats. The CDM also provides standard APIs for <em>georeferencing coordinate systems</em>, and specialized queries for <em>scientific data types</em> like <em>Grid</em>, <em>Point</em>, and <em>Radial</em> datasets. </p>
