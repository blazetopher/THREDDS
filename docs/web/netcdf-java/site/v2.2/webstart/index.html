<h2>Install and run via WebStart</h2>
<ol>
  <li>If you dont already have it installed, <b><font size=+1><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">install 
    Java 1.4 </a></font></b>This will also install WebStart&nbsp;and the Java 
    Plug-In.</li>

  <br>
  &nbsp; 
  <li> When first starting, you will see a window that says:</li>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>This application is requesting unrestricted access to your machine.Do 
        you want to install and run: <b>NetCDF Tools UI</b> <br>
        Signed and distributed by: <b>www.unidata.ucar.edu</b></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Indicate "yes" by pressing the "Start" button.</p>
</ol>
<h2><br>
  Possible Webstart problems:</h2>
<h3>General Problem Diagnosis:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Start up <strong>javaws.exe</strong>, the webstart application manager. This usually lives in a subdirectory of the jre directory, eg <em><strong>/home/j2sdk/jre/javaws/javaws.exe</strong></em>. Windows users often have a desktop icon for it. You may be able to find it using &quot;<em><strong>which javaws</strong></em>&quot; from the command line. Note the path, it tells you which java runtime you are using. If its pre 1.4.2, you will want to upgrade. </li>
  <li>Once its running, from the top menu, choose <strong>File &gt; Preferences.</strong></li>
  <li>Go to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and make sure <strong>Show Java Console</strong> is checked. This will cause a webstart console window to open, whenever a webstart application starts, showing error messages etc. When something goes wrong, look in that window.</li>
  <li>Go to the <strong>Java</strong> tab and check which runtime version is being used. The ToolsUI application requires 1.4.2 or above. Make sure there is a 1.4.2 runtime that is enabled. If not, you can search for one with the <strong>Find</strong> button. If you cant find one, then you need to install one, then come back here and make sure it gets enabled.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Specific Problems: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Problem</b>: After clicking on "Launch," you get a message from Netscape 
    asking if you want to save the file "netcdfTools.jnlp". 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Diagnosis</b>:&nbsp; After installing WebStart, you must exit Netscape 
        and start up again. If that doesn't work, log out and back on. <br>
        &nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Problem</b>: Upon launching, you get the error message:</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>An error 
occurred while launching/running the application.</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Category: Launch File Error</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Unsupported JNLP version in launch file: 1.0. Only version 0.2 is supported with 
this version</i> 
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Diagnosis</b>: you have an old version of WebStart. Download the current 
      version. <br>
      &nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Problem</b>:&nbsp; Right after starting, the application is not responding 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Diagnosis</b>: There is a dialog box that has been covered by the 
        application, that is waiting for you to dismiss it.&nbsp; You have to 
        find the dialog box and dismiss it before the app will be responsive. 
        To uncover it, try iconifying and deiconifying other applications, until 
        the dialog box pops to the top. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
