At this point there should be a basic tomcat installation. To test it, start
it, check the logs, use a browser, and then stop it.

<pre>

- To start tomcat
% cd /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/bin 
% ./startup.sh

- To check the logs
% cd /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/logs 
% less catalina.out
	The following line should appear if started ok.
		INFO: Starting service Catalina

  Another check is to see if a browser can find tomcat
	http://localhost:8080 
	should see:
		If you're seeing this page via a web browser, it means you've setup Tomcat successfully. Congratulations!

- To shut tomcat down
% cd /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/bin 
% ./shutdown.sh

- Remove the logs files, they have a tendency to get large.
% cd /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/logs 
% rm *

Your installation is now ready to install the THREDDS Data Server (TDS) that
will be discussed in it's own section.
