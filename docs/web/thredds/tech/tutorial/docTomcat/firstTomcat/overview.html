Apache Tomcat is the servlet container that is used in the official Reference 
Implementation for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies. The Java 
Servlet and JavaServer Pages specifications are developed by Sun under the Java 
Community Process. The THREDDS Data Server runs inside this environment and it
depends on Tomcat to provide the necessary data interactions and security
measures. To make this environment secure, a user tomcat needs to be created 
with limited permissions. 

<p>
Also, if Tomcat is going to be accessible from a public network then a firewall
should be installed in the initial setup. There is another separate section on
installing other security measures for remote management that we recommend too.

<p>
To create a secure environment, there is a set of steps that need to be done 
as root and a set of steps for user tomcat. It is important that tomcat doesn't 
get more permissions then is necessary, so the steps should be followed closely
because it is easy to expand the permissions.
