<title>Steps done as root</title>

<pre>
For this tutorial it is assumed that apache-tomcat-5.5.17.tar.gz is the old
distribution and the new one is apache-tomcat-5.5.25.tar.gz

- Go to where tomcat is installed
% cd /opt

- Get tomcat5 distribution ie apache-tomcat-5.5.25.tar.gz from: 
	<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Apache Tomcat</a>

- Make a directory of the distribution name 
% mkdir apache-tomcat-5.5.25

- Change ownership of  distribution directory to user tomcat:tomcatUID
% chown tomcat:tomcatUID apache-tomcat-5.5.25

- Remove/Make link from distribution directory to tomcat
% rm tomcat
% ln -s apache-tomcat-5.5.25 tomcat


Note: Do not unpack the tomcat distribution as root because the user tomcat
will not be able to configure the distribution.
