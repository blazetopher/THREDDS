Eventually one will want to upgrade to a new version of Tomcat or new version
of THREDDS Data Server but they will want to save the state of the present 
installation. Saving the state, avoids the problem of redoing the configuration or most
of the configurations. Also, if the upgraded is done correctly then it is 
possibile to
 return to the old installation easily if there is a problem with the new
installation.
