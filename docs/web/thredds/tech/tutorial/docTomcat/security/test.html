TDS Remote Debugging

Once SSL is enabled, you can remotely debug and configure the TDS.

Using a browser, go to:
http://localhost:8080/thredds/debug. 

Some features of particular interest are:

   1. Show Logs allows you to look at the TDS access logs, to see who is using your server.
   2. Reinitialize will reread in the TDS catalogs and reinitialize itself, 
      without having to restart the server. Use this whenever you make changes 
      to the TDS catalogs.
   3. Show Catalog Errors shows you any errors when reading the TDS catalogs. 
      Check this after you run Reinitialize.

TDS catalogs can be modified remotely through HTTPS GET and PUT commands that 
work on the "raw"catalog.xml using a special URL. For example, the main 
catalog will have the URL http://hostname:8080/thredds/content/catalog.xml. 
The NetCDF ToolsUI is currently under development to make this convenient to do.
