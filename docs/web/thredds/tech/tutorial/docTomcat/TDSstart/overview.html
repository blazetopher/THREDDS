The THREDDS (Thematic Realtime Environmental Distributed Data Services) project
is developing middleware to bridge the gap between data providers and data 
users. The goal is to simplify the discovery and use of scientific data and to 
allow scientific publications and educational materials to reference scientific 
data. 

<h2>Tomcat Directory Layout</h2>
<p>
The Tomcat version is apache-tomcat plus the version number, so the sample is 
this tutorial is ${tomcat_version} = apache-tomcat-5.5.17.

<p>

The Thredds software is kept under ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/webapps/thredds. This area is 
overwritten whenever a new thredds.war file is installed.

<p>
Any files that you will modify or add are kept under ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/content/thredds. 
<p>
Its a really good idea not to put any files containing passwords here, or 
anything with security issues. Typically you will only be adding and modifying 
catalogs.

<p>
The subdirectories of ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/content/thredds are used by specific 
servlets, for example, files in ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/content/thredds/cataloggen are 
used by the Catalog Generator servlet, etc.

<p>
These directories are populated with default values the first time the Thredds 
applications are run, so its important to start up the Thredds servlet 
immediately after installing, before you change or add new files that might 
get overwritten. The presence of an empty file called 
${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/content/thredds/.INIT indicates whether the default files have 
been copied - its important not to delete this file.
