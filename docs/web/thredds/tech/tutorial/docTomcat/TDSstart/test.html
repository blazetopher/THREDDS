<p>

At this point there should be a TDS installation. 

<pre>

- In the ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/logs directory
% less catalina.out
The following line should appear if started ok.
	INFO: Starting service Catalina

</pre>
<p>
Now one should see messages about the TDS server starting up. There
might be some error messages, but these are usually the result of some
start up processes not being synchronized. At this point, ignore them.

<pre>

The tomcat check is to see if a browser can find tomcat
http://localhost:8080 
	should see:
	If you're seeing this page via a web browser, it means you've setup Tomcat successfully. Congratulations!

The TDS check is to point your brower at:
	http://localhost:8080/thredds/catalog.html 

</pre>
<p>
You should see the Thredds default catalog. This initializes the 
content directories with defaults (after this step, you can edit these 
without worrying about them being overwritten).
