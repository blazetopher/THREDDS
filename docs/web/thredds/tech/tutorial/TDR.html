<hr>
The main focus of the TDS has been to serve real time data that arrives at a server by a separate mechanism such as
our Unidata Internet Data Distribution (<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idd/">IDD</a>) system.
<p>
    The THREDDS Data Repository (TDR) is a server that complements the TDS by providing a method for clients to
    upload data and metadata to a TDS.  The TDR provides this functionality:
    <ul>
        <li>file upload capability via HTTP (and support for gridftp)</li>
        <li>a means for a client to structure the catalogs and data</li>
        <li>incorporation of metadata provided by the client</li>
        <li>generation of additional metadata</li>
        <li>uploading a collection of data as single file </li>
    </ul>
</p>
To date TDR development has been steered by two use cases.  First is the creation and maintainence of a case
study archive, the Next Generation Case Study (NGCS) project.  Second is the needs of the LEAD cyberinfrastructure
project.
