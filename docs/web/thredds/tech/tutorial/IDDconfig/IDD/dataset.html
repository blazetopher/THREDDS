To be able to distribute the IDD/TDS configuration, the datasets need to be in
certain directories so the preconfigured TDS catalogs can find the datasets. 

<h2>Creating the static directory structure</h2>
<p>
Since the LDM is used to deliver the data for the IDD, the LDM needs to be
configured to create the data directories for the TDS catalogs. To configure the
LDM to create the necessary data structures, TDS pqact files need to be 
installed in the LDM. The TDS pqact files have been developed by the THREDDS
staff to create the correct directory structure and the correct dataset names.
These pqact TDS files are:
<pre>

pqact.thredds   // create directories for model, text type products, plus others
pqact.threddsradar // create directories for level II and III radar data
pqact.threddsconduit // create directories for high resolution model data

</pre> 

If the above pqact files are installed in the ldmd.conf file, then the correct
data structures are created. This tutorial assumes that one is familar with the LDM
and understand about LDM configurations, if that is not the case then click 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm">here</a>. The ldmd.conf 
configuration looks like:
<pre>

exec    "pqact -f ANY-CONDUIT-NNEXRAD-CRAFT etc/pqact.thredds"
exec    "pqact -f NNEXRAD|CRAFT etc/pqact.threddsradar"
exec    "pqact -f CONDUIT|SPARE etc/pqact.threddsconduit"

</pre>
To download the latest pqact files, click on the name with the right mouse 
button:

<pre>


<a href="pqact.thredds">pqact.thredds</a>
<a href="pqact.threddsradar">pqact.threddsradar</a>
<a href="pqact.threddsconduit">pqact.threddsconduit</a>


</pre> 
 
Once the ldmd.conf has been configured, the LDM needs to be stopped and started
for the new pqact file to take affect.

<pre>

stop and start needs to be done as user ldm
% ldmadmin stop
% ldmadmin start

</pre>

<p>

The desired TDS directory structure will now be created without one having to 
do any configurations, the pqacts will do it for you.
