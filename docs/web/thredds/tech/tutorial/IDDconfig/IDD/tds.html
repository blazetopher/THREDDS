<p>
At this point the datasets are in the correct location and they are being
managed correctly. The final part is to configure the TDS to access the 
datasets.
When tomcat is started for the first time with the TDS installed, it creates a
content directory that is peer to the bin, logs, conf, webapps, ... directories
and it is populated with the default TDS configuration. 

<h2>Configure the IDD/TDS catalogs</h2>

<p>
The configuration is simple, change the default catalog to the IDD catalog that
is included in the TDS distribution. 

<pre>
 
Change to the top catalog location
% cd ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/content/thredds
Save the default catalog (catalog.xml)
% mv catalog.xml catalog.dist
Get the IDD/TDS catalog from the distribution
% cp idd/catalog.xml .

</pre>

<p>
As user tomcat, stop and start tomcat.

<pre>

% cd ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/bin/shutdown.sh
% cd ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/bin/startup.sh

</pre>
<p>
At this point the IDD/TDS is configured to access the IDD datasets.
