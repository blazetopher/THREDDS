Unidata has build a system to distribute near real time data over the internet
using the LDM called the IDD(Internet Data Distribution System). The IDD 
contains many different types of data from
varies data providers that include NWS, NCEP, FSL, CMC, etc The data ranges
from model data to varies types of text reports, radar images, satellite
images, etc. To get detailed information on the varies type of data, click

Click <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.html">here</a>to see Unidata's IDD/TDS server

<p>
THREDDS has under taken the task to distribute much of this dataset using the
THREDDS Data Server(TDS). This is a large effort that required over 3 months
in configurations and it's still a moving target. Datasets have changed,
distribution patterns change, new datasets added, etc. But, the basic TDS
configuration is the same so it does permit us to help others install the
configurations so they can also provide the IDD data. There are three main parts
to the configurations:

<pre>

static dataset directories structures
managing the datasets
configurating the TDS 

</pre>

<p>
By following the above guide lines, one will be able to distribute the IDD
data and more important be able to add to the structure to distribute other
data that is not on the IDD. This is a community effort, so if one has a
dataset that is of interest to others it might be beneficial to distribute
the data on the IDD.
