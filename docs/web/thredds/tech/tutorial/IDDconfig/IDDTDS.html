<title>Configuring the TDS for the IDD</title>

<p>

Unidata has build a community-oriented Data stream to deliver data over the 
internet that is called the Internet Data Distribution system (IDD). 
<a href="realtime_idd.gif"> Current IDD system </a>
The IDD contains many different types of data from data providers that include 
NWS, NCEP, FSL, CMC, etc The data ranges from model data to varies types of 
text reports, radar images, satellite images, etc. 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/data">Here</a> is a list of the different data types available on the IDD. 
<p>
One of the driving forces of the TDS development has been to be able to 
distribute all the data on the IDD data stream. THREDDS distributes
about 80% of the data at this time.

<p>
Click <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.html">here</a>to see Unidata's IDD/TDS server
<p>
This <a href="ndfd_model.xml">catalog</a> is the one that created the NDFD web 
page in the Unidata's IDD/TDS server.

<h2>IDD catalog configuration</h2>
<p>
The TDS distribution includes the IDD catalogs that can be installed so one
can mimic the Unidata IDD/TDS server. First, the TDS must be configured so the server can access the IDD catalogs. Then the data infrastructure has to be in place for the catalogs to work correctly.

<p>
The configuration is to change the default TDS catalog to the IDD 
<a href="catalog.xml">catalog</a> that is included in the TDS distribution. 
<p>


<pre>
 
Change to top catalog location
% cd ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/content/thredds
Save the default catalog (catalog.xml)
% mv catalog.xml catalog.dist
Get the IDD/TDS catalog from the distribution
% cp idd/catalog.xml .

</pre>

<p>
As user tomcat, stop and start tomcat.

<pre>

% cd ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/bin/shutdown.sh
% cd ${tomcat_home}/${tomcat_version}/bin/startup.sh

</pre>

<h2>Dataset directories infrastructures</h2>
<p>
When we were inspecting the ndfd_model.xml catalog above, I pointed out the 
location element in the catalog. This is where the data resides on the disk
and is where the catalog expects to find the data.
To use the IDD catalogs without making any changes, the IDD datasets infrastructure
must be in place. For a simple solution, use the 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm"> LDM </a>  software to create
the infrastructure.

<p>
Since the LDM is used to deliver the data for the IDD, the LDM can be
configured to create the data directories for the TDS catalogs. To
configure the LDM , TDS pqact files need to be installed in the LDM. The
TDS pqact files have been developed by THREDDS developers to create the
correct directory structure and the correct dataset names. These pqact
TDS files are:

<pre>

pqact.thredds   // create directories for model, text type products, plus others
pqact.threddsradar // create directories for level II and III radar data
pqact.threddsconduit // create directories for high resolution model data

</pre> 

Add the following 3 lines to the etc/ldmd.conf file around the other exec lines:
<pre>

exec    "pqact -f ANY-CONDUIT-NNEXRAD-CRAFT etc/pqact.thredds"
exec    "pqact -f NNEXRAD|CRAFT etc/pqact.threddsradar"
exec    "pqact -f CONDUIT|SPARE etc/pqact.threddsconduit"

</pre>
Click on the name with the right mouse button to download the latest pqact files.

<pre>


<a href="pqact.thredds">pqact.thredds</a>
<a href="pqact.threddsradar">pqact.threddsradar</a>
<a href="pqact.threddsconduit">pqact.threddsconduit</a>


</pre> 
 
Once the ldmd.conf has been configured, restart the LDM so the new pqact
file to take affect.

<pre>

stop and start needs to be done as user ldm
% ldmadmin stop
% ldmadmin start

</pre>

<h2>Managing the datasets</h2>
<p>
Since the IDD works with near real-time datasets, they are dynamic. The
datasets arrive constantly, usually at the rate of 1-5 per second. If the
files were not deleted in a timely manner, the LDM data partition would
fill up in a matter of days .


<h3>Removing datasets</h3>
<p>
The IDD/TDS has developed a script that runs once a day to remove the oldest 
files, keeping a certain number of files in the directory. The script is 
called 
<a href="manageFilesDirs.pl">manageFilesDirs.pl</a>, that has a configuration file called
<a href="manageFilesDirs.conf">manageFilesDirs.conf</a>.  Both files contain 
documentation in the header explaining the usage of the files. 
The manageFilesDirs.pl
is usually located in the ~ldm/util directory and it's run out of a crontab
in an off peak hour. It takes about 1-2 hours to scan a large directory
structure. The manageFilesDirs.conf file usually resides in the ~ldm/etc
directory. Using the manageFilesDirs script one can regulate the number of files
to retain and to keep the the LDM data directory at consant usage level without
worry.

<h3>Pre indexing GRIB files</h3>
<p>
 
Since the IDD/TDS distributes GRIB files there is also another script that is used
to index the files for the TDS. To speed up the access time for the files,index
the files before they are requested.
To pre-index the files, the <a href="GribIndexer.pl">GribIndexer.pl</a>
is used with the configuration <a href="GribIndexer.conf">GribIndexer.conf</a> file. 
A couple configurations found in the GribIndexer.pl script are needed before it
can be used.
The configuration need are the location of
Java 1.5, Tomcat home, and what version of Tomcat. 
Both files contain
documentation in the header explaining the usage of the files.
The GribIndexer.pl script should be run every 10 minutes from crontab
to keep the indexing up to date. Besides indexing the GRIB files, an
inventory file is also created. This file extracts the metadata from the GRIB
file. It's recommended to install GribIndexer to improve performance of the
TDS.
