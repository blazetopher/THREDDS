<hr>
  <p>
    All TDS configuration information is stored in a directory
    that is created the first time the TDS is run. The
    configuration directory, generally
  </p>
  <pre>${TOMCAT_HOME}/content/thredds,</pre>
  <p>
    is created and populated with default files the first time
    a TDS installation is run. It is persistent even when a TDS
    installation is upgraded or re-deployed. All your configuration,
    modifications, and additions should be made in this directory.
    Do not place files containing passwords or anything else with
    security issues in this directory. Typically you will only be
    adding and modifying catalogs and configuration files.
  </p>

<h2>Content of Configuration Directory</h2>
  <p>
    For now, we will focus on the following subset of the content directory:
  </p>
   <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
     * ${TOMCAT_HOME}/content/thredds/
           o .INIT - the presence of this file indicates whether the default files have been copied - it is important not to delete this file.
           o catalog.xml - the main TDS configuration catalog (root catalog for TDS configuration)
           o enhancedCatalog.xml - an example catalog [Note: It is referenced from catalog.xml.]
           o logs/
                 + catalogErrors.xml - messages from TDS configuration contains information on the TDS configuration catalogs
                 + threddsServlet.log
   </pre>


<h2>Changing the Default Location of Configuration Directory</h2>
<p>
  TDS 4.0 (now in alpha release) supports configuring the location
  of the "content/thredds" directory by setting the "tds.content.root.path"
  system property. For instance, by adding the following to JAVA_OPTS
  in your startup script:
</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
-Dtds.content.root.path=&lt;some_absolute_path&gt;
</pre>

The TDS will look for the config catalog files in the directory
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">&lt;some_absolute_path&gt;/thredds</pre>
