THREDDS Catalog Generator example configuration files.

Two kinds of configuration files:

config.*.xml - examples of the config.xml file that needs to be
    placed in the directory above this one. The config.xml file is the
    setup used by the servlet to know what catalogs to create, how
    often to create them, and what CatalogGenConfig file to use.

configCatGenConf.*.xml - examples of the CatalogGenConfig files that
    tell the catalog generator how to create a catalog for your
    collection of datasets.
