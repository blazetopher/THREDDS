THREDDS DQC example configuration files.

Two kinds of configuration files:

config.*.xml - examples of the config.xml file that needs to be
    placed in the directory above this one. The config.xml file is the
    setup used by the servlet to know what DqcHandlers to allow and
    what DqcHandler config documents to hand them.

configDqcHandlerConf.*.xml - examples of a DqcHandler config file. Each
    type of DqcHandler specifies the config file they require.

dqc.*.xml - examples of a DQC document.
