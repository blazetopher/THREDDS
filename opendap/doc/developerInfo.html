<p>Javacc takes a grammar file and produces a Java source code file from it.
    All of these resulting Java source files are checked into the CVS tree, so
    unless you anticipate working on the grammar files themselves you will not
    need to get Javacc. Most of the OPeNDAP parsers rely on the <strong>JavaCC</strong> tool
    to build. The parsers are built from a grammar file with a .jj extension. The
    grammars
    contain
    the rules for
    both the scanner and the parser (and thus encapsulate both the functionalities
    of <strong>lex</strong> and <strong>yacc</strong>). The Javacc tool appears
    to be a red headed step child of the Java development community. Originally
    it was written by someone at Sun Microsystems ( possibly Bill Joy?). Eventually
    it was farmed off to small company called WebGain. It now appears that WebGain
    went
    under
    in
    the Dot Com bust and now
    Sun has
    it
    in an
    Open Source project under the BSD license. I think it survives because it does
    something important, we can't live without it, and there is nothing else like
    it out there. If you are going to work on the parsers you should :</p>

    <em><strong>Recommended</strong></em><strong>:</strong> 4.1.27</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This code has not been tested against version 5 of Tomcat!</p>

<p>The servlets were developed and tested using Jakarta/Tomcat 4.1.18. In particular,
    the code was linked against the servlet.jar bundled with this particular version
    of Tomcat. This is not (to the best
    of my knowledge) a library that is included with the standard Java distributions.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ant.apache.org/"><font size="+1">ANT</font></a></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Minimum</strong></em><strong>: </strong>1.5.2 (<a href="#ANTWARNING">Warning!</a>)<br>
    <em><strong>Recommended</strong></em><strong>:</strong> 1.6 or higher</p>

<p>This software now builds entirely with ANT. If you haven't already got ANT,
    then go get it: You need it. There is a master build file in the top level
    directory, <em>Java-OPeNDAP/build.xml</em> which relies on the numerous build
    files located in the <em>Java-OPeNDAP/buildfiles</em> directory. The master
    build file contains only a few simple targets. The serious developer will want
    to read and understand the collection of build files in the <em>buildfiles</em> directory.</p>

<p><em><strong>Compiling the source:</strong></em> This should be straight forward.
    Just go to the top level directory and type &quot;ant compile&quot;. For more
    detailed instructions you should
    read the
    master build file, Java-OPeNDAP/build.xml, and the core build files in
    Java-OPeNDAP/buildfiles.</p>

<p><em><strong>Compiling the parsers:</strong></em> First let me point out that
    unless you are actively involved in parser development for OPeNDAP you shouldn't
    bother with this. The parsers are built using JavaCC, which takes grammar files
    (.jj) and makes Java code from them. This Java code is checked into the OPeNDAP
    CVS tree and thus does not need to be rebuilt unless the underlying grammar
    (.jj) files have been changed, which is strongly discouraged unless you are a
    OPeNDAP core programmer. <strong>I suggest you turn back now</strong>. Still
    here? I warned you...</p>

<p>The <em>parsers</em> target
    in the <em>opendap.xml</em> build
    file uses the &lt;javacc&gt; task
    build the parsers. The javacc task requires that the local installation of
    JavaCC be identified as an attribute.
    In order to
    build the parser you will need to create a separate properties
    file
    (that is <strong>not</strong> checked
    into CVS). This file must be called <em>javacc-config</em> and it must live
    in the <em>Java-OPeNDAP/buildfiles</em> directory. The content of the <em>javacc-config</em> file
    must be the property <em>JavaCC.home</em> and its value should be set to the
    top level directory of the JavaCC distribution on your development system.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the content of the <em>javacc-config </em>file:</p>

<pre>
    JavaCC.home=/usr/local/javacc
</pre>

Once you have created the <em>javacc-config</em> then the <em>parsers</em>
target in <em>Java-OPeNDAP/buildfiles/opendap.xml </em>should work, at least
within the constraints of the <a href="#ANTWARNING">Warning</a>.
<p><em><strong>Using the deployment targets:</strong></em> There is a separate
    ANT build file called <em>catalina-targets.xml</em> in <em>Java-OPeNDAP/buildfiles</em> which
    contains a number of targets (<em>webapp-deploy, webapp-remove, webapp-redeploy</em>)
    that allow the developer to build the software and deploy it into a running
    Jakarta-Tomcat
    (aka Catalina) server, and one target (<em>webapp-list</em>) to check on
    the running servlets in Tomcat. Also, for the sake of rapid development and
    conservation of effort, the <em>opendap.xml</em> build file contains two targets
    (<em>deploy</em>,
    and <em>quick-deploy</em>) that will compile the project (with and without
    the JavaDoc's respectively) and put it into a running Tomcat server.</p>

<p>All of these targets require that you
    modify
    your
    local installation of ANT (see below)
    and that
    you create an ANT properties file to configure the ANT tasks to talk to and
    authenticate with Tomcat. </p>

<p>The properties file must called <em>catalina-config</em> and
    it must be located in <em>Java-OPeNDAP/buildfiles</em>. The <em>catalina-config</em> file
    must contain three property definitions: <em>Catalina.url</em>, <em>Catalina.username</em>,
    and <em>Catalina.password</em>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the content of the <em>catalina-config</em> file: </p>
<blockquote>
    <pre>
        Catalina.url=http://localhost:8080/manager
        Catalina.username=admin
        Catalina.password=secretstuff
    </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Where the username and password pair will authenticate as a Tomcat manager
    (see below)</p>

<p>Additionally you will need to configure ANT as described
    below in this excerpt from the
    Tomcat
    4
    online
    documentation:</p>
<pre>
    In addition to the ability to execute Manager commands via HTTP requests Tomcat
    4 includes a convenient set of Task definitions for the Ant (version 1.4
    or later) build tool. In order to use these commands, you must perform the
    following setup operations:


    * Download the binary distribution of Ant from http://jakarta.apache.org/ant.
    You must use version 1.4 or later.
    * Install the Ant distribution in a convenient
    directory (called ANT_HOME in the remainder of these instructions).
    * Copy the file server/lib/catalina-ant.jar from your Tomcat 4 installation into
    Ant's library directory ($ANT_HOME/lib).
    * Add the $ANT_HOME/bin directory
    to your PATH environment variable.
    * Configure at least one username/password combination in your Tomcat user
    database that includes the manager role.
</pre>

<p> You may wish to read more about the configuration issues for Tomcat. Check
    out the online documentation in your running version. Assuming that you have
    tomcat running on port 8080, then at: http://yourhost:8080 You should find
    the additional information you need.</p>

<p><strong><em><a name="ANTWARNING"></a>Warning</em></strong>: <font size="-1">There
    exists a version conflict between some versions of ANT and some versions
    of JavaCC. If you have JavaCC 2.1 or
    2.0 then the parsers should compile
    fine, no matter what version of ANT you have. However, if you are using JavaCC
    3.0 or newer (released after the JavaCC project migrated from WebGain to Java.Net)
    older versions of ANT will fail to correctly identify the JavaCC libraries. The
    mail and bug archives indicate that the problem was fixed as of 5/26/2003,
    but the patch won't migrate into a release until version 1.6.
    You can grab a nightly build of Ant release 1.6beta as work around until 1.6
    hits the street. Good luck.</font></p>

<p><strong>Additional Libraries:</strong></p>

<p>The core software depends on several third part libraries. All of these are
    included with the distribution, and these (should) be the ones that the code
    was compiled against for development and testing purposes. It is possibly (in
    fact likely) that newer versions of these libraries are available from the
    various development teams that create these products. Replace them at your
    own risk.</p>

<p> The <strong>JDOM</strong> package, version Beta 9, available from <a href="http://www.jdom.org">jdom.org</a><br>
    The <strong>gnu regexp</strong> package, version 1.1.4, available
    from <a href="http://www.gnu.org">gnu.org</a><br>
    The <strong>gnu getopt</strong> package, version 1.0.6, available form <a href="http://www.gnu.org">gnu.org</a><br>
    The <strong>Apache SOAP</strong> package, version 2.3.1, available from <a href="http://ws.apache.org/soap">apache.org</a>
</p>

<h3>Building the code</h3>

<p>Building the Java-OPeNDAP software should be very simple.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go get and install the current J2SE and ANT (<a href="#DEPENDS">see above</a>)</li>
    <li>If you haven't got it already, get the source code distribution from <a
            href="http://www.opendap.org/">OPeNDAP</a>.</li>
    <li>Unpack the source code distribution (jar -xvf DistributionFileName.jar)</li>
    <li>Enter the top level directory (Java-OPeNDAP)</li>
    <li>Run the command &quot;ant compile&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>This will compile all of the distributed software, but nothing more. Each
    sub project in Java-OPeNDAP has it's own build file with targets that are unique
    to it. For more detailed information you should
    read (and
    try to understand) the ANT files
    in <em>Java-OPeNDAP/buildfiles</em>. For
    those of you using an IDE you will have to follow your own &quot;path&quot; to
    get this going.</p>
