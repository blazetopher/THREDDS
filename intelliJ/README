IntelliJ IDEA project and module files

You should be able to use these files "As Is" (see below for some exceptions).
Just select the thredds.ipr file from the IntelliJ IDEA "File | Open Project..."
menu item. Click on the "Project" side-bar item on the left side of the IDEA
window to open up the project view. You should see the following modules:

"cdm" - the client side netcdf-java and thredds code
"intelliJ" - the IntelliJ IDEA project files (Please don't add or commit
             things to Subversion in this module unless you are sure everyone
             will want that change.)
"lib" - the libraries used by  the various THREDDS modules
"tds" - the THREDDS Data Server (TDS) code
"ui" - the ToolsUI code

Now for the non-"As Is" part. There are several things to setup that are
specific to your local machine and working directory:

1) Make sure a valid JDK is selected.
  a) Bring up the "Settings" window by clicking on the "wrench and bolt" icon.
  b) Bring up the "Modules" window.
  c) Select the "Libraries" tab.
  d) If the JDK is shown in red, click the "..." button and select a valid JDK.
2) Make sure a valid web application server (like Tomcat) is selected.
  a) Back in the "Modules" window, make sure the "tds" module is selected.
  b) Select the "Web Module Settings" tab.
  c) If the "Application Server" is shown in red, click the "Configure ..."
     button and select a valid application server.
3) Setup the Ant builds (optional).
  a) From the right sidebar, click on the "Ant Build" item.
  b) Click on the "Add" button at the top of the "Ant Build" window.
  c) Browse through your directory structure to the location where you checked
     out the project source.
  d) From there, locate the Ant build script files ("build.xml"); there is one
     in the "cdm" directory and on in the "tds" directory.
  e) Select one of the build scripts and select "OK".
  f) Repeat steps b-e for any other build scripts.
4) The TDS Ant build uses some Tomcat deploy add-ons. To use the TDS build
   script, the catalina-ant.jar file must be available to Ant. There are two
   ways to set this up. Either:
   1) Setup IntelliJ IDEA to run Ant with catalina-ant.jar on the class path.
     a) In the "Ant Build" window, select the "tds" build script. Bring up
        the "Properties" window by clicking on the "Properties" icon (looks
        like a check list) at the top of the "Ant Build" window.
     b) Select the "Additional Classpath" tab.
     c) Click on the "Add" button.
     d) Browse your directory tree to find a copy of catalina-ant.jar. The
        Tomcat distribution contains one in the server/lib directory.
     e) Select the copy of catalina-ant.jar and click on the "OK" button.
   OR
   2) Copy catalina-ant.jar (distributed with Tomcat) into the lib directory
      of the Ant being used by IntelliJ IDEA.
     a) In the "Ant Build" window, select the "tds" build script. Bring up
        the "Properties" window by clicking on the "Properties" icon (looks
        like a check list) at the top of the "Ant Build" window.
     b) Select the "Execution" tab.
     c) Look at the setup of the Ant being used (default or custom) to
        determine the location of the Ant lib directory.
     d) Copy catalina-ant.jar to the Ant lib directory.
